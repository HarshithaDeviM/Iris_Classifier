# Iris Species Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal characteristics. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for the project.
- **Flask (Web Framework):** Used to build the web application.
- **scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library):** Utilized for implementing machine learning models for species classification.
- **HTML/CSS (Frontend):** Responsible for creating the user interface.
- **Render:** The project is hosted on the Render.

## Features

- **Input Fields:** Users can input key features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Prediction:** The system predicts the Iris species based on the provided input.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
